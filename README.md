# OpenSea NFT Catagory Floor Bids
* **Description:** This Dapp will enable users to place a limit buy order, or a "bid", on a floor NFT in a selected collection. This order is fulfilled if and when any NFT in the selected collection is listed below the set catagory floor bid price.
* **Example:** If the floor price for Bored Ape NFTs is 10 Eth and I bid 5 Eth on that collection, if a Bored Ape was listed at 5 Eth, the Dapp would fulfill my bid and process the transaction.  
* **Why this Dapp is needed:**  OpenSea currently allows users to bid on individual NFTs, but often users want to trade "floor" NFTs because they are considered more liquid, and determining rarity isn't as crucual. This Dapp will allow users to effectively make collection floor bids. This Dapp will also increase NFT liquidity on the whole, becauese it creates market making buy orders. In a future iteration, Sellers could accept and fulfill these buy orders without even listing on Opensea.
